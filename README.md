# IOI GRANT RESEARCH PROJECT

The repository is a working ground of the ongoing research on 2019 IOI participants data. The aim is to analyze the whole competition data to derive useful information such as correlations and causations.

## INSIGHTS

Insights folder consists of 4 directories each of which describes contestant behavior from different aspect. Each folder contains SQL scripts, which can be run on the contest's 
PostgreSQL database, and the corresponding output data. Names of these folders and a short description for each of them are listed below:
1.  Contestant requests statistics: Contestant request count for each type of request at intervals of 30 min
2.  Daily submission statistics
3.  Solution approaches
4.  WC requests statistics

## DATABASE

The database folder consists of a README.md and an images folder. The importance of the readme file is to have all the ERD schema of the contest database in a neat form. The images folder consists of 2 files one is the general iconic image that has been used in the readme file and the latter one is the ERD schema in a format of png. This makes it easy to see the whole schema at once.
