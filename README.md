# IOI GRANT RESEARCH PROJECT

The repository is a working ground of the ongoing research on 2019 IOI participants data. The aim is to analyze the whole competition data to derive useful information such as correlations and causations.

## INSIGHTS

This part of the research introduces the insights on IOI 2019 data, that start as general statistics and then followed by specific targeted analysis, accompanied with the findings. All insights and short description for each of them are provided in the list below:
1.  **Submission Dynamics:** Computes the number of submissions in a 30-minute interval and visualizes them on a separate diagram for each task. Each diagram shows the number of totals (orange line) and successful (gray line) submissions. Any submission scored more than 0 is considered as successful. So the gap between the lines shows the submissions that did not score anything.
2.  **Contestant requests statistics:** Examines contestant requests statistics and combines this knowledge with the issues occurred during the contest days to come up with the solutions which can help contestants to have overall better contest experience.
3.  **Switching Between the Tasks:** Compares the different strategies employed by contestants during the contest day 1 and 2 by investigating the number of task switches and the amount of time spent on tasks. Based on the insights an algorithm is provided that can be used by contestants to maximize their outcome.
4.  **A Team Performance:** Presents another report that shows the success of the teams according to their performance in IOI 2019. 

## DATABASE

The database folder consists of a README.md and an images folder. The importance of the readme file is to have all the ERD schema of the contest database in a neat form. The images folder consists of 2 files one is the general iconic image that has been used in the readme file and the latter one is the ERD schema in a format of png. This makes it easy to see the whole schema at once.
